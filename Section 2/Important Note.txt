In the next lecture, I will go through instructions to setup local service in your machine which we will be using in next few lectures for practice.


If you have any troubles in Setting up the service which involves multiple software's. You can simply use below Service URL which is hosted on cloud 
to save your time and skip next lecture completly :)

http://216.10.245.166:8080/axis2/services/EmployeeManagementService?wsdl  
Above WSDL is same as the one which you will seeing in the next lecture to setup in your local.

You can import above URL   instead of below
 when ever I refer to the WSDL link in the lectures

http://localhost:8082/axis2/services/EmployeeManagementService?wsdl
