Section 1, Lecture 1
If you want to follow all steps along with me and complete course challenges please perform following steps:



1. Install Node.js for your operating system https://nodejs.org/

2. Install Visual Studio Code Editor (other editor would be OK too) https://code.visualstudio.com/

3. Create project folder on your computer with any desirable title. In my case title of the initial project folder is "babel-intro".

4. Inside of the project folder create "src" subfolder and add empty "index.js" file to it.



And you are good to go!

Happy Learning!
