=============================================
This sample contains source code for the xdocs/1_1/pojoguide.html document found in 
the extracted Axis2 Documents Distribution. For a more detailed description on the 
source code kindly see this 'POJO Web Services using Apache Axis2' document.

Object), and deploy it on Apache Tomcat as a Web service in the exploded directory 
format. This is a quick way to get a Web service up and running in no time.
