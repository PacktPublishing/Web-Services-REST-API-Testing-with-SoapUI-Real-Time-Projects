In upcoming 2 sections, You will learn on testing Google Maps ADD Place , Delete place API.

But Google Maps Add and Delete API are now depreciated. 
 And they may not work as expected!

Google Map Place Search which we have seen in last lecture Still works . You can play around with this. 
But I would strongly recommend to go through all the lectures in sequence (though Add and Delete are depreciated) to understand
 how Google API works as most of real time API's will be on same lines of this API and these are stepping stones for Rest API Automation learning. 
 But Unfortunately it is not available for practice now as google depreciated it   (Place Search Still works)

But do not worry! 
 As a work around and for Practice, I have designed another API called Library API.  Please find the details of the API from the attached document
 of this lecture. And also I have attached POSTMAN Project of it with examples..
 Just import that project into POSTMAN and check the example to see how it is working.  This API have all the Add , GET and Delete operations just like
 Google Map API.  I would suggest you to use this as practice as an alternative to Google Maps.    But before that  complete all the videos till Section 3 
and then open the document so that you can relate with what you have learned till that point.

Thanks!
